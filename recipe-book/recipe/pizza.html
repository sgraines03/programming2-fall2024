        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
    
        <li> Prepare the dough:
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix 3 ½ cups of flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour. Stir until the dough begins to come together.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        <li> Prepare the sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Add a pinch of sugar if the sauce is too acidic.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            </ol>   
            <br>
        </li>
        <li> Assemble the pizza:
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two portions (if making two pizzas). Roll each portion into a round shape on a floured surface. Make the dough as thick or thin as you prefer.</li>
                <li>Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza peel or baking sheet (with parchment paper if needed). Spread a thin layer of sauce on the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings on top of the cheese.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
       </li>
        <li> Bake the pizza:
            <ol>
                <li>Carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh basil if desired, slice, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
       </li>
     </ol>
    Tip: For a crispier crust, bake the pizza on the lower rack of the oven, or pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes before adding toppings.
